This file computes the value of c_q_max (used to compute \hat\epsilon in the paper) for the following cases
- MOLS l=5, r=3 (Table 3 of paper) for q = 2,...,5
- Ramanujan Case 2 l=5, r=5 (Table 4 of paper) for q = 3,...,7

The above examples serve as a demo that can quickly be reproduced. If one needs more results the corresponding parameters
need to be set in the file.
