# ByzShield
ByzShield's robust distributed ML framework implementation

This project builds on [DETOX] and implements our proposed ByzShield algorithm for robust distributed deep learning. Our placement involves three different techniques, namely MOLS, Ramanujan Case 1 & Ramanujan Case 2. It also includes three different types of attack on the DETOX system.
